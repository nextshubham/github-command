Basic git commands:
1.Create account and create repo(for specific project) over there.
2.Install git software git-scm in your machine

commands:-
set user email and name for folder(setting the flags):
>git config --global user.email "nextshubham@gmail.com"
>git config --global user.name "nextshubham"

right now the project is not a git project to convert it into a git project we need to run a command.

>git init

now a hidden folder named  .git is created.

now we need to set the file to stagging area which we want to upload to git ,for that we run a command to check the status of files .

>git status

now you may see untracked files here if you want to track them (upload them) you need to add them to git stagging area for that there is a command.

>git add .
(dot for all files or you can mention file name you can copy and paste the file name froom there) or git add -A will also work for all.

Now all files which you mentioned are in green means tracked.

now you need to take snapshot of files which means you can save upto a stage at local and can go back to that stage you also need to mention the message also.

> git commit -m "index.html and style.css added"


upto here everthing is local we are doing now we need to upload over code to github hosting.


now we need to link local repo to github hosting,you can get the repo link from github website.

>git remote add origin https://github.com/nextshubham/ebay.git

now we are linked with our online github hosting
so we need to push our code to it.

>git push origin master

(First time it will ask password)

now all the files are uploaded on github hosting

now just suppose one of the developer need that files than what he will do he will run this command .
>git clone https://github.com/nextshubham/ebay.git

he will get all the files which are present.

now suppose you created a new file and now run git status once again it will show that file is untraced.

now add that file 
>git add .

now you need to take snapshot
>git commit -m "adding index.js"

now connection is already there we just need to push once again.
>git push origin master

now that other guy also need that update file so he will run
>git pull origin master 

in the same folder so will get that updated code.
